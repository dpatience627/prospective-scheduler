Might need the following command for routes to work:

npm install react-router-dom

How we will be using it:

Inside of index.js within a BrowserRoute the following structure:
<Routes>
	<Route path="LOCATION" element={"PAGE COMPONENT}>
</Routes>

This defines the routes, then to navigate between them, use a Link from
'react-router-dom' to navigate to that page.

To see this, look inside of the Navigation.js file.
